# Algorithms and Data Structures-2
Algorithms and Data Structures 2 faculty subject.
## Content (Syllabus outline)
In course Algorithms and Data Structures 2 student
learns about the basic tools for the analysis of
algorithms complexity and problem complexity.  
  
Basic mathematical tools  
order functions O, Ω, Θ and differences between them;  
what is the complexity of a problem and what is the  
complexity of a solution;  
probability and randomization;  
models of computation;  
basic analysis of data structures and algorithms.  
Radix trees (trie)  
basic implementation,  
path and level compression.  
Disjoint sets and amortization.  
Dictionary  
deterministic solutions,  
probabilistic solutions.  
Priority queue  
basic abstract data structure (heap),  
extended abstract data structure (binomial and  
Fibonacci heap, vEB).  
Sorting  
problem complexity,  
method of exhaustive search,  
method of divide and conquer  
method of use of existing data structures,  
sorting in linear time,  
sorting in parallel.  
Rank and select  
dynamic data structure (extended trees),  
static data structure (median).  
Method of dynamic programming.
Algorithms of graphs and networks  
topological sorting,  
greedy method: minimum spanning tree,  
relaxation method: shortest paths,  
maximum network flow,  
parallel algorithms and Internet.  
Selected algorithms  
optimization problems: use of Bloom's filter, method  
branch and bound;  
mathematical algorithms and cryptography: matrix  
multiplication, solving system of equations, FFT,  
maximum common divisor, modular arithmetic,  
exponents;  
algorithms on strings and bioinformatics: pattern  
search.  
With all problems we will also take a brief look at  
parallel solutions.  
## Objectives and competences
Student gets familiar with basic methods for analysis
and design of data structures and algorithms, and learns
how to evaluate their quality.  
General competencies: abstract and analytical thinking,
capability to define and formalize the problem,
literature study and approach to a seminar work.
Specific competencies: modularization, encapsulation
and abstraction; basics of engineering knowledge in a
sense of integration of existing solutions, evaluation of
quality of a solution, differentiation between the
problem and solution (one of), knowledge of applying
an algorithmic approach – how to develop an algorithm
to solve a problem.

## Intended learning outcomes
Student learns basic terms in data structures and
algorithms design.
(S)he learns how to analyze problems and then combine
solutions into a general solution, and evaluate their
quality.
