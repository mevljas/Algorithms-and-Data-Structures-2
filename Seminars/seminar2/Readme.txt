i have made two Bash scripts for calling a Java program.
You run the one that suits you best.
The Seminar2.java file and the selected script must be in the same directory.

Script1.sh: Specify the path to the input file as the first argument.
              It will create an output file in the input file directory.

Script2.sh: Specify the path to the directory containing the input files as the first argument.
              The script will create an output file for each input file in the specified directory.
