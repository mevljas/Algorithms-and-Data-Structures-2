# Seminar work 1
**Program the seminar in the Java programming language.** The template already contains methods for reading input and printing to output as well as a very simple algorithm. You are expected to exceed this algorithm.  

Have your program place the pieces on the board. The percentage of game board coverage is measured. If you find at least one solution in a given time that completely and correctly covers the board, this means the maximum possible number of points for a given problem. Otherwise, try to cover as much as possible. There does not have to be full coverage for a given problem.

Your program will be evaluated as follows. The evaluation algorithm will prepare the input data and pass it to the standard input (System.in) of your program. The parameters that will vary are the size of the game board and the number and shape of the components that your program places on the board. Each program will be given 1 minute for each input. During this time, have your program print the state of the game board to standard output (System.out) at least once. It can also print multiple times, the evaluation algorithm will consider the best solution. If no solution is printed within 1 minute, such a solution is evaluated with zero points for the given problem. If the state of the game board is displayed and is correct according to the problem definition, the percentage of game board coverage is scored.
